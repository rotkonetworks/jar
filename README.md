# Grey

A JAM (Join-Accumulate Machine) blockchain node implementation in Rust, following the [Gray Paper v0.7.2](https://github.com/gavofyork/graypaper/releases/download/v0.7.2/graypaper-0.7.2.pdf).

### Conformance Testing

Grey includes a conformance target binary (`grey-conform`) that speaks the JAM fuzz-proto v1 protocol over Unix domain sockets, compatible with [minifuzz](https://github.com/davxy/jam-conformance), Polkajam, and Jamzig fuzzers.

**Status**: 8 of 100 blocks passing on the `0.7.2/no_forks` trace (blocks 1–8). Block 9 fails with a state root mismatch (accumulation side-effects under investigation).

```bash
# Quick test: replay trace and show pass/fail per block
python3 scripts/run_conform.py

# Dump state at a specific block for debugging
python3 scripts/dump_state.py --block 8

# Run against minifuzz directly
cargo build --release --bin grey-conform
./target/release/grey-conform /tmp/jam_target.sock &
python res/conformance/minifuzz/minifuzz.py \
  -d res/conformance/fuzz-proto/examples/0.7.2/no_forks \
  --target-sock /tmp/jam_target.sock
```

See [docs/conformance-testing.md](docs/conformance-testing.md) for the full debugging guide, protocol details, and script reference.

### Known Spec Issues

See [docs/pvm-sbrk.md](docs/pvm-sbrk.md) for a documented ambiguity in the Gray Paper's `sbrk` definition that caused a conformance failure.
